### Project Title
EXPLORE US BIKESHARE DATE

### Description
In this project,I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote the code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

In this project,I used data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I also compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.


### Software Requirements
You should have 
* Python 3,NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
* A text editor, like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).
* A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).


### Files used
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* wishington.csv

### DATA SETS
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year
